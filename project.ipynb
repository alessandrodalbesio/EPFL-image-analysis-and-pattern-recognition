    "In this project, you will be working on solving tiling puzzles using image analysis and pattern recognition techniques. Tiling puzzles are a classic type of puzzle game that consists of fitting together pieces of a given shape (in this case squared to form a complete image. The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can automatically reconstruct tiling puzzles from a single input image. \n",
